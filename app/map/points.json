There are multiple different lines that can be scouted from a large pull-out at mile 2.3 along the Banks-Lowman Road. From the top of the rapid to the run out is about 1/3 of a mile.\n\nWhile bank scouting Staircase, take note of the large entrance rock left of center, which is called Whale rock. There is another round boulder right-of-center that forms an eddy in the middle of the rapid called the 'Duck Pond,' most kayakers try to catch this eddy on the way down. A good line can generally be found down the middle between Whale rock and the Duck-Pond-Boulder. Entering the rapid just to the left of the Duck-Pond-Boulder and going down the center will position you the best for both catching the Duck Pond and missing the upcoming holes. 50 yards below Duck Pond, is a sweeping bend to the river, called Carnage Corner, right before this bend is a big hit with holes and/or waves depending on the flow. Holes here are not super retentive, but if it can get sticky if you founder in sideways or upside down, so this is a common spot for boaters to swim. At low flows (800ish and down) Carnage Corner can form rocky ledges that are a good idea to scout from the bank. Below Carnage Corner the river flatens out for a ways, but the water is still fast and churny so it's still near impossible to clean up a swimmer. There is one last class fun wave-hit/drop at the bottom before the river mellows.\n\nThere are other lines to the left of Whale Rock that are common for kayakers to take. However, below Whale Rock's eddy there are some rocks that can be dangerous. They like to catch wood, many rafts have wrapped on a rock left-of-center, and there is also a sieve rock on river left that is known to have drowned a raft guide years ago.

This rapid is more of a class IV- than a class IV, but it is a challenging rapid with unpleasant consequences if you end up in one of the holes. At lower flows these holes are pretty small, easy to punch if you have some rocker to your kayak.\n\nTowards the end of the rapid on river left is a pair of large rocks known locally as the Dolly Parton's. These are fun to eddy out behind. At high flows, Dolly's go from eddy to dark death hole. Directly below Dolly's on full river left is a fun optional boof. Its a green water ledge with a hole at the bottom that isn't very retentive. Paddlers like to gather in the following the eddy to gather stragglers and watch their boofs.

If you don't want to run it, the portage is on the far river right side and you'll still need to boat through the middle entry way to get there (a Class II move above a Class V drop)..\n\n \n\nThe classic line is down the left at the entry, through the ramp with a very slight right angle to punch breaking hole at the bottom, and then out to the center to finish the rapid. There's a fair potential to get typewritered left at the ramp hole, and this puts boats along the left wall, which can be tricky to escape from. If you don't manage to get away from the wall, stick to it all the way down and avoid the large hole (or large rock at lower flows) that lurks at the bottom left of this long line. This line is in at nearly all levels.\n\n \n\nAt medium-low to low-medium levels (1,500 - 3,500 cfs), various lines open up in the middle and middle right sides of the rapid. To get to these, you need to enter the lead-in near the center of the river and quickly move to the middle or right side where you can reset to choose your particular line. Beware that there are some sieves and undercuts in the bouldery middle line; these can be avoided, but be sure you know where you're going and don't beater here.\n\n \n\nAt higher flows (above 5,000 cfs) there is an obvious high boof in play. If there's enough water to paddle over the boof rock it's good, just make sure to launch from a spot without rocks below. If there's not enough water to go over the boof, there may be enough to run the upstream-angled slide line off the river left side of the boof rock to a 180º turn in the current below.\n\n \n\nThe farthest right narrow chute is usually run by rafts at medium to high flows. Rafts will need to ship oars to squeeze through. It works for kayaks and other craft too, but most will choose another route that is typically more fun and inviting.\n\n \n\nThere's a long pool below this rapid and before Achilles.

There's a pushy but non-retentive hole at the bottom right here, and it was once feared by all boaters. It's still enough to cause excitement, and most boaters angle left and paddle hard to avoid the hidden vertical drop along the wall and its hole. But others are now setting up to jump the hole on the right, which is harder to do than it appears: you really have to aim and charge hard for the right wall (but don't actually reach the wall or you're likely to land on a small rock shelf).\n\nIf needed, there is a rough dirt road that connects the river bar here to Salmon River Road on river left.\n\nAchilles Heel is named for an incident involving kayaker Peter Sturges, the founder of Otter Bar Lodge Kayak School, in the early 1980s. Paddling a pointy-nosed Perception Mirage, Peter pitoned in the bouldery entrance to the rapid and his heel slid beneath the footbrace in the kayak, tearing his Achilles tendon. Ironically, Peter's paddling partner that day was Don Banducci, the owner of Yakima, which made the footbraces.

A ledge drop against a rock wall on the left, with boulder garden (not runnable at low flows) on the right. At typical flows the best route for inflatable kayaks is very close to the rock wall, where a surging wave circumvents a large reversal created by the ledge drop. It is almost impossible for inflatable kayaks to run the ledge drop hole without flipping. Fortunately the swim is clean and there is a large recovery pool below. At higher flows the boulder garden is your best route: above 2500 cfs, the right side is a series of 4 to 6 big waves with nearby holes, and lots of fun!
